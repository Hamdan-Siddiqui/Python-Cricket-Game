# Python Cricket Game üèè

A simple, fun cricket game built using Python and `tkinter`. Play against the computer by choosing to bat or bowl, and see if you can outscore your opponent!

## Features
- **Interactive Batting and Bowling**: Choose your runs and try to avoid getting out.
  
- **Toss Simulation**: Decide to bat or bowl based on a coin toss.
- **Incredible Visuals**: See different images for game actions like runs scored or getting out.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Run the program:
   ```bash
   python cricket_game.py
   ```

2. **Toss**: Choose heads or tails. If you win, pick to bat or bowl first.

3. **Gameplay**: 
   - **Batting**: Select runs (1-6) and try to avoid matching the computer's random pick.
   - - **Bowling**: Select runs (1-6) and try to match the computer's choice to get it out.

4. **Results**: After both innings, you‚Äôll see if you won, lost, or drew the game.

## Setup
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Organize your GIF files (`single.gif`, `double.gif`, etc.) in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the game by executing:
   ```bash
   python cricket_game.py
   ```

## Requirements
